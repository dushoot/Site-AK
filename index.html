            <h2>Key Milestones in My Life</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At 17 ‚Äî became a <a href="https://www.chem.msu.ru/rus/olimpiad/russia/2016/welcome.html" target="_blank">winner</a> of the Russian National Chemistry Olympiad.</li>
                <li>At 18 ‚Äî won <a href="https://www.chem.msu.ru/rus/olimpiad/olimp2016/welcome.html" target="_blank">gold</a> at the International Chemistry Olympiad.</li>
                <li>At 19 ‚Äî learned speed reading and started a <a href="https://vk.com/photos49370858" target="_blank">blog</a> where I reviewed books (over 300 reviews published over a few years). Launched my first entrepreneurial projects: the faculty's first <a href="https://vk.com/saltmsu" target="_blank">printed newspaper</a> and a <a href="https://vk.com/deggsl?from=search" target="_blank">dark kitchen</a> in the dorms.</li>
                <li>At 20 ‚Äî led the design department at the <a href="https://xn--80a2ac.xn--p1ai/" target="_blank">"–ê–ü–û"</a>. That same year, interned at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olegbraginsky/?locale=fr_FR" target="_blank">Braginsky Bureau. Business Consulting</a>.</li>
                <li>At 21 ‚Äî consolidated all my MSU-related activities under the brand of a project agency called the <a href="https://vk.com/tsrumsu" target="_blank">"–¶–†–£"</a>.</li>
                <li>At 22 ‚Äî completed the <a href="https://youtu.be/IjFynbPDcb4?si=g3xPrWwC36p513jB" target="_blank">Physical Culture Day challenge</a>: ran 100 km, did 500 pull-ups and 1000 push-ups in 23 hours and 56 minutes. Also launched a <a href="https://youtu.be/78sMZXwfweI?si=77HjmXqp_fgSrKYP" target="_blank">speed reading course on YouTube</a>, which remains the top Russian-language course on the platform.</li>
                <li>At 23 ‚Äî sold my share in the AI startup <a href="https://slai.tech/" target="_blank">Slai</a>, which we had been building for 1.5 years, to a French competitor.</li>
                <li>At 24 ‚Äî graduated from MSU <a href="https://youtu.be/WCBvkqafF70?si=a-GzCpUR3ciFp0Oa" target="_blank">with honors</a> and started working full-time on my <a href="https://t.me/shasschool/7" target="_blank">educational platform "#–©–ê–°"</a>, which had been a side-hustle since COVID shut down offline projects.</li>
                <li>At 25 ‚Äî raised funding, reached 50,000+ customers, and sold the platform for Azerbaijani IT company.</li>
                <li>At 26 ‚Äî figured I'd try the corporate life for a change. Joined <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valeriya-miloserdova-099715235_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%BE-%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8F-%D0%B4%D0%B6%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D1%8F-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%8E-activity-7218990213719560192-Wub6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank">Tinkoff</a> as a product manager. Quickly realized that corporate life wasn't for me (maybe because I wasn't at C-level yet), so I left, and joined a hedge fund as an EIR (Entrepreneur In Residence) to lead <a href="https://gendalf.ai/" target="_blank">Gendalf.ai</a>.</li>
                <li>At 27 ‚Äî still at <a href="http://gendalf.ai" target="_blank">Gendalf.ai</a>.</li>

            <h2>Ten Random Facts About Me</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>I had second-degree obesity as a kid.</li>
                <li>I once lost 20 kg in three months to impress a girl I had a crush on.</li>
                <li>During my university years, I was the only student from the entire chemistry faculty who was invited to the dean's office ‚Äî not for trouble, but to help with projects.</li>
                <li>I love playing Civ5 and Dota.</li>
                <li>I'm a lieutenant of the Russian troops for radiation, chemical, and biological defense.</li>
                <li>I tried polyphasic sleep. Didn't work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2bh5bkZ1n6g" target="_blank">Video</a></li>
                <li>I've been vegetarian, done keto, paleo, and at least ten other less popular diets ‚Äî all as experiments on myself.</li>
                <li>I really wanted to open my own bar (I'm a chemist, after all). So I worked as a bartender to see how it works from the inside. After five months and five different bars, I realized: getting people drunk when you're drunk ‚Äî kind of fun. Getting people drunk when you're sober ‚Äî absolute hell.</li>
                <li>My archetype is the Jester (also known as the showman or entertainer). I need to play, joke, make people laugh, perform, and be in the spotlight.</li>
                <li>I love plov, tom yum, sushi rolls, chicken biryani ‚Äî basically anything with rice. I can't stand pasta, noodles, pies, khachapuri or any other flour-based stuff.</li>
